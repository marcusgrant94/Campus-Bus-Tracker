 The Issue

Students waste time waiting at shuttle stops because they don‚Äôt know when the bus will actually arrive. Full GPS tracking can be expensive, and relying on word of mouth or printed schedules is inaccurate and frustrating.

 Our Solution

The Smart Shuttle ETA Web App logs each shuttle‚Äôs last stop + timestamp and uses segment travel time data to calculate the estimated arrival at upcoming stops.

Students open the web app, pick their route and stop, and instantly see:

 Last stop the shuttle passed

 Estimated time until arrival

 A simple ‚Äúlast seen‚Äù breadcrumb trail

Drivers/dispatchers log arrivals/departures with a single tap (or QR scan).

Admins can monitor usage, optimize routes, and view reports.
